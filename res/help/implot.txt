This is my favorit ploting fiture, it allowes you to do an implisit plot, that is the solution set of an equation of two variables.
Just write \implot followed by the equation. The function variables are assumed to be x and y (Lower case).

My favorit example:
\implot x**2 + ( 5*y/4 - sqrt(abs(x)) +.2)**2 = .7

See also \help plot and \help set.
