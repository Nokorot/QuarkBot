You can define shortcuts for frequently used code for simplicity. Just write \define shortcut code. If you desire to delete this shortcut, simply write \undefine shortcut.
If you use any of these commands on a group chat that includes me, all members of the chat will have access to the shortcuts and they will only be available within that group.
However, if you would like to restrict the shortcuts for yourself, you can use the \define commands on your private chat with me.
Then, you will also be able to use your shortcuts on any chat that I am included in.
