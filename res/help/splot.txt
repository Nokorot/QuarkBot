In case you would like to plot the graph of a 2-variable function you, can use the \splot command, followed by the formula for your function.
The function variables are assumed to be x and y or r and theta, where r²=x²+y², x=r*cos(theta) and y=r*sin(theta). Examples:

- \splot cos(4*pi*(x**2+y**2))*exp(-3*(x**2+y**2))
- \splot r**2*sin(8*theta)
- \splot x**2*sin(4*theta)

See also \help plot and \help set.
