Hey, I am Quark Bott, a facebook message bot.

My main job is to compile LaTeX code.
Just type \latex followed by some code and I will reply with a image containing the result.

Try for example:
- \latex \int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

You can also have text in front, like this:
- Euler's identity \latex e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

There are some other features also. I can plot the graph of functions.

Try some of these:
- \plot sin(2*pi*x)
- \splot 2*x**2 - y**2
- \implot x**2 + (5*y/4 - sqrt(abs(x)) +.3 )**2 = .8

Also try the help command:
- \help
to list the avable commands  that exists.
