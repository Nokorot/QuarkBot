In case you wish to do something graphical, I can also graph/plot any function you might be interested in.
Simply write \plot followed by the formula for your function. The function variable is assumed to be x.
Using pyplot the following functions are defined;

abs, acos, asin, atan, atan2, ceil, cos, cosh, degrees, exp, fabs, floor, fmod, frexp, hypot, ldexp, log, log10, modf, radians, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, tanh

The constants e and pi are also defined. Example:

- \plot cos(4*pi*x)*exp(-4*x**2)

In case you would like to plot the graph of multiple functions at ones, you can separate the functions with a comma. Example:

- \set lc 'red','blue'
  \set lw 3,3
  \plot cos(2*pi*x), sin(2*pi*x)

See also \help set.
